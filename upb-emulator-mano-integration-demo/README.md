# SONATA Emulator to MANO Integration Demo

In this demo, we showcase an emulation platform that executes containerized network services in user-defined multi-PoP topologies. The platform does not only allow network service developers to locally test their services but also to connect real-world management and orchestration (MANO) solutions to the emulated PoPs. During our interactive demonstration we focus on the integration between the emulated infrastructure and state-of-the-art orchestration solutions like SONATA and OSM.

## Background

### Demo Presentation

This demo was presented in IEEE NetSoft 2017 demo track, July 2017, Bologna, Italy:

* M. Peuster, S. Dr√§xler, H. Razzaghi, S. v. Rossem, W. Tavernier and H. Karl: [**A Flexible Multi-PoP Infrastructure Emulator for Carrier-grade MANO Systems**](https://cs.uni-paderborn.de/fileadmin/informatik/fg/cn/Publications_Conference_Paper/Publications_Conference_Paper_2017/peuster_netsoft_demo_paper_2017.pdf). In IEEE 3rd Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft) Demo Track. (2017)

* Demo support slides [download](https://github.com/mpeuster/son-tutorials/raw/master/upb-emulator-mano-integration-demo/doc/sonata-emulator-integration-demo-slides.pptx) 

### Containernet

Containernet is a Mininet fork that allows to use Docker containers as hosts in emulated networks. This enables interesting functionalities to built networking/cloud testbeds. The integration is done by subclassing the original Host class.

### MeDICINE (son-emu)

The MeDICINE emulation platform was created to support network service developers to locally prototype and test complete network service chains in realistic end-to-end multi-PoP scenarios. It is part of SONATA's SDK where it is called _son-emu_. It allows the execution of real network functions, packaged as Docker containers, in emulated network topologies running locally on the network service developer's machine.

## Demo

### Demonstration VM

There is a _ready-to-use_ demo VM that can be downloaded and used to perform this demo:

* [SONATA Emulator Integration Demo VM 2017 Download](http://www.peuster.de/SONATA/todo) (~20GB since it ships with OSM, and SONATA service platform pre-installed)

Import and start the downloaded VM using VirtualBox (see also: [Import VM to VirtualBox](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E26217_01/E26796/html/qs-import-vm.html)).
